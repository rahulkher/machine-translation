In twenty or so temples and monasteries, we need to come from 00 to the temple. We are in twenty or so temples and monasteries. I sat down for a bit and then went back. I still had some time left, so I put it away. Then I turned south a bit and could go. On one side, there was something more. Follow me, turn with me, receive the transmission, receive the transmission to 58. This path leads to the boat. You want to head south, head south, head south, head south, head south. It's fine at 200 degrees. How many? Twenty-six sides, twenty-six sides. I heard nothing. Then I turned east a bit and could go. In Tokyo 34, in North America, there are 258 places. I heard nothing. I heard nothing. I heard nothing. There is no 55 north side. I saw nothing. Hit you once, hit you once.
